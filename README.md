### Installing-Bitmessage-on-Linux-Tutorials  
## December, 2020
#### All the Documents you need to install are located in the Danrancan/Installing-Bitmessage-on-Linux-Tutorials/Docs folder


The developers of PyBitmessage are excellent at programming, but lack the time for proper documentation and tutorials. This is my attempt to help end users install and try out the experimental messaging protocol known as PyBitmessage, on several cleanly installed Debian based Linux Distributions.  In this Project you will find tutorials on how to properly install and run PyBitmessage, on your debian based distribution. 

The aim of this project is to rectify dependancy issues for the end user of Bitmessage, and document proper installation methods that are currently undocumented, outdated, or poorly documented. This is a project for end users.

To install Bitmessage properly, you have two options:

1) You may follow a tutorial that has been written for your specific version of Linux, or
2) you may use my automated install bash scripts that I have created to expedite the installation of PyBitmessage from source on your linux distribution. You will not have to do much manual work if you use the automated install scripts.

The Docs folder has both the scripts as well as the tutorials that you will need for each distribution.

Feel Free to contact me with any questions.
